# Installing a tarball by path skips the resolution that decides which of the
# four platform packages a machine downloads, which is the part most worth
# testing. cs-npmrevs makes every revision of an npm package installable without
# publishing it: it serves the packages built here, and passes every other
# package through from npmjs.com.

# Nothing here touches ~/.npmrc or npmjs.com. The npmrc it writes lives in the
# state directory and is passed with NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG, and cs-npmrevs refuses
# every write, so nothing run through that npmrc can publish anywhere.
