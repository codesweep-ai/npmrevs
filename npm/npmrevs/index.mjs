//
// The binaries themselves ship as one package per platform, each marked with
// the `os` and `cpu` it is for and listed as an optional dependency of this
// one. npm installs the single package that matches and skips the rest, so a
// machine downloads one binary rather than four. This file is the lookup that
// finds it again at run time.
//
// It is exported rather than kept private because a project that wants to run
// the registry from its own script needs the path, and reaching into another
// package's directory to guess it is what this export exists to prevent.
